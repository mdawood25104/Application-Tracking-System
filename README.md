## 🚀 Introduction & Objective

The **Applicant Tracking System (ATS)** is designed to help job seekers improve their resumes to better match job descriptions. The system leverages Google’s **Gemini Model** for natural language processing and advanced data analysis techniques to simulate how an ATS evaluates resumes. 

The primary objective is to ensure that users have resumes optimized for ATS systems used by companies, increasing their chances of landing an interview. The app provides:

- **Percentage match** between the resume and job description.
- **Missing keywords** that are essential for a particular job.
- A comprehensive **profile summary** with strengths and weaknesses.
- **Interactive features** to generate professional feedback.

## 🎯 Features

- Analyze resumes and **match** them with job descriptions.
- Extract **missing keywords** required for the job.
- Display a detailed **profile summary** including strengths and improvement areas.
- **Streamlit-based interface** for easy interaction.

## 🧑‍💻 Technologies Used

- **Python** for backend development.
- **Streamlit** for building the web interface.
- **Google Generative AI** (Gemini model) for resume analysis.
